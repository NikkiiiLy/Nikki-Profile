                <h2>From <strong>Telecom to Tech</strong>: Navigating a Career Shift in the Tech Industry</h2>
                <p>I'm a coffee-loving telecom engineer with eight years of experience in the industry. <br> Despite
                    enjoying my
                    work,
                    I've decided to make a career shift to become a web developer. <br> As a self-taught enthusiast, I'm
                    excited
                    to
                    explore the world of coding and design to create engaging and functional websites. <br> When I'm not
                    tinkering
                    with
                    code, you can find me spending time with my furry companions—a cat and a dog—whom I adore.</p>

                    <h3>Telecommunications</h3>
                    <p>I am an experienced telecommunications professional with eight years of expertise in both wired
                        and
                        wireless
                        technologies, including VoIP, fiber optics, and network operations. <br> Throughout my career, I
                        have
                        been involved
                        in a diverse range of projects, from network installation and maintenance to designing and
                        implementing VoIP
                        systems. <br> One of my most notable achievements was leading a team that deployed a wireless
                        network for
                        a large
                        retail chain, improving their operations and customer experience. <br> I am well-versed in
                        utilizing
                        a
                        variety of
                        telecommunications tools and technologies and am passionate about delivering reliable,
                        efficient,
                        and secure

                    <h3>Web Development</h3>
                    <p>I am passionate about web development and aspire to become a professional in the field. <br>
                        Currently, I
                        am in the
                        early stages of my learning journey and am focusing on studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
                        Although
                        I am a
                        beginner, I am motivated to improve my skills and knowledge in both front-end and back-end
                        development. <br> I
                        understand that this will require a lot of dedication, patience, and consistent effort over a
                        long
                        period of
                        time. <br> I am thrilled about the prospect of mastering the different aspects of web
                        development
                        and
                        using my skills
                        to create beautiful and functional websites and applications in the future.</p>

                <p> <strong>Coding:</strong> I love spending time on my computer, writing code and creating programs.
                    It's
                    amazing to see how
                    a few lines of code can turn into something useful and functional. Whenever I face a challenge, I
                    put my
                    problem-solving skills to the test and try different approaches until I find a solution.</p>

                <p> <strong>Researching web contents:</strong> One of my favorite things to do is to search for
                    information
                    online. I find it
                    fascinating how much knowledge is available on the internet, and I enjoy reading articles and
                    watching
                    videos on various topics. Sometimes, it can be hard to filter out reliable sources from fake news,
                    but
                    it's always rewarding when I find a trustworthy piece of information.</p>

                <p> <strong>Crafting:</strong> When I'm feeling creative, I love to make things with my hands. Whether
                    it's
                    knitting a scarf,
                    sewing a dress, or making jewelry, crafting allows me to express my personality and create something
                    unique. It can be a bit time-consuming and sometimes challenging, but the end result is always worth
                    it.
                </p>
                <p> <strong>Playing with my cat and dog:</strong> Spending time with my furry friends is one of the
                    highlights of my day.
                    Whether we're playing fetch, cuddling on the couch, or going for a walk, it's always a joy to be
                    around
                    them. Pets are great companions, and I feel lucky to have them in my life.</p>
